Things mentioned on Glassdoor:
- Speed vs. quality.

	- I want to work hard, but don't want to be pressured. And I might want some time to myself for learning things and doing projects.
	- Sales teams overpromise.
- "slave to clients"
- Mentions of short-sightedness and too many business people
	- Getting as many clients as possible; keep taking their money
	- "Get more nerds to help with the real decision making. A technology company run by a bunch of formers CEO's is just how you expect it. Direct stress downwards, get as many clients as possible, keep taking their money, and never generate anything of real value."
	- Management doesn't listen. (mentions of wanting people to challenge the status quo on the website)
