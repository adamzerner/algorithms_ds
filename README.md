Specs and code for the algorithms and data structures I learn.
- First I went through https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool/playlists and implemented some data structures and algorithms.
- Now I'm going through a big algorithms textbook and implementing the ones they teach.
	- The textbook is http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Edition-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844 .
	- It's on the book shelf at Fullstack.
- I'm taking the [Algorithms Part 1](https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-007) course on Coursera, and will be updating this repo with specs and JavaScript implementations for the algorithms taught in lecture.
	- Also, check out my demos of the assignments: https://algorithms-assignments.herokuapp.com/
